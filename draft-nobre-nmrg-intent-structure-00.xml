    <abstract>
      <t> 
Intent-Based Networking is an approach to operate a network through the use of an abstract, high-level policy. 
An intent-based management system is composed of several components. One of such components is an engine to translate the intents into the network configuration.
In this context, this engine must be able to parse network intents, given a defined structure. 
This document mostly discusses the structure of network intents as well as associated concepts. 
The aim is to provide a foundation for intent-related research and development. </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>  
      <!-- 
       The vision of intent-based networks has attracted a lot of attention
   because it promises to simplify the management of networks by human
   operators.  This is done by simply specifying what should happen on
   the network without giving any instructions on how to do it.  This
   promise caused many researcher-led activities and telecom companies
   to start researching this new vision and many Standards Development
   Organizations (SDOs) to propose different intent frameworks.

   This document proposes an intent classification methodology and an
   intent taxonomy.  The scope of these proposals is to ensure a common
   understanding in the research community in terms of what the intent
   users, intent types, or intent solutions, etc., are for specific
   scenarios that are being considered.

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
