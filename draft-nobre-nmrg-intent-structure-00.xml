    <abstract>
      <t> 
Intent-Based Networking is an approach to operate a network through the use of an abstract, high-level policy. 
An intent-based management system is composed of several components. One of such components is an engine to translate the intents into the network configuration.
In this context, this engine must be able to parse network intents, given a defined structure. 
This document mostly discusses the structure of network intents as well as associated concepts. 
The aim is to provide a foundation for intent-related research and development. </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>  
	An intent-based management system must be able to parse network intents, given a defined structure, in a way that it can be easily automated the translation among customer expectation and configuration needs at provide side to accomplish those expectations.

	This document overviews potential structure of intents as departing point for use within NMRG activities on intents.

    <section title = "General structure of intents">
      <t>  	    
The activities around intent-based networking have been recently explored by different SDOs, as for instance 3GPP and ETSI ZSM. These SDOs have produced some documents where intent structure is investigated.
For instance, ETSI ZSM [RefZSM] describes a declarative model based on information object classes. Five classes are defined:
five types of information objects are required - intent,
Intent, which includes a list of one or more intentExpectations to be achieved
intentExpectation, which declares the final objective of the customer with the intent
IntentTarget, which describes the desired outcome of the intent, and that includes for a given targeted parameter both the KPI for that target and any applicable context
Context, represented by a tuple of < attribute, condition, value range >, which imposes constraints to the targets 
FulfillmentInfo, which indicates the state of the intent
In the case of 3GPP, a similar structure is defined in [Ref3GPP]. Object classes are defined in the same manner to accommodate the customers intents.
For NMRG no initial structure has been defined yet. Considering the fact that the underlay network, using IETF-based technologies, supports services defined in other SDOs, it seems reasonable to assume a similar structure also in NMRG and explore its suitability in the context of IETF. Thus adaptations to the particularities of IETF could be expected in this exercise.
It is interesting to mention that the object classes defined above allows to nest classes in the different levels. For instance, an Intent can nest various intentExpectations, each of them nesting different intentTargets, and so on.
   
	      </t>	
	    </section>
	    
	    <section title = "Basic example of connectivity service">
   <t>		    
As a basic example of a simple connectivity service can illustrate a possible use of the referred intent structure. 
Considering a scenario where connectivity between different edge sites could be needed, such connectivity can be expected to be performed according to some SLOs. 
As characteristics of that connectivity service, it could be expected to receive from the customer inputs about:
   </t>
		    
Endpoints location
Connectivity matrix
Service duration
SLOs
etc	
	   With this in mind a possible intent structure could be the following:
IntentExpectation – “Communication Service”
ObjectType – “Connectivity”
ObjectContext – “edgeEndPoints” 
IntentTarget – “SLO”
ObjectStateAttribute – “Bandwidth”
TargetCondition – “is at least”
TargetValueRange – “100 Mbps”
TargetContext – “99,9%”
IntentTarget – “SLO”
ObjectStateAttribute – “Latency”
TargetCondition – “is less tan”
TargetValueRange – “10 ms”
TargetContext – “90%”
ExpectationContext – “connectivityType” 
IntentContext – “edgeList”

This central part (within the square lines) should be repeated for every set of edgeEndPoints requiring different connectivityType or particular SLOs (bandwidth, latency, etc). 
    </section>
			
    <section title = "Open points">
	    
<t>
	    This initial version of the document proposes to explore valid structure of the intents to be used in NMRG. Apart from assessing the validity of the approach, other aspects are yet open points:
Nest different kinds of intents for intent use cases in NMRG, (e.g. draft-contreras-nmrg-transport-slice-intent-06, draft-contreras-nmrg-interconnection-intents-03, etc).
Assess that the structure is able to support the intent lifecycle defined in RFC9315
Alignment with intent classification in RFC9316

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
